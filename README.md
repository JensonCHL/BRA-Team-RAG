# RAG Document Handling Application with Simplified Authentication

This application provides a complete solution for ingesting, processing, and querying contract documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

## Current Authentication System

The application now implements a simplified two-layer authentication system:
1. **HMAC Email/Password Authentication** - First layer for identity verification
2. **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) MFA** - Second layer for multi-factor authentication

### Multi-User Support

The application now supports multiple users with individual credentials:
- Configure users in the `.env` file using `USER{n}_EMAIL` and `USER{n}_PASSWORD` format
- Each user has their own independent MFA setup
- Example:
  ```
  USER1_EMAIL=admin@example.com
  USER1_PASSWORD=AdminPass123
  USER2_EMAIL=user@example.com
  USER2_PASSWORD=UserPass456
  ```

### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

- Uses TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) standard
- Compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.
- QR code setup for easy configuration
- Manual entry option for TOTP secrets
- Per-user MFA secrets stored securely in `user_secrets.json`

## Features

- PDF document ingestion with OCR processing
- Document chunking and embedding
- Qdrant vector database integration
- Supabase metadata storage
- Web-based UI with Streamlit
- Document management (view, select, delete)
- Secure authentication with MFA

You can restrict access to the application in two ways:
1. **Domain Restrictions** - Limit access to specific email domains
2. **Account Whitelist** - Limit access to specific email addresses

## Setting up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

After completing Google OAuth and password authentication, users will be prompted to set up TOTP-based MFA using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator.

### Initial MFA Setup

1. After entering your password, you'll be directed to the MFA setup screen
2. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
3. Enter the 6-digit code generated by your app to verify setup
4. Once verified, you'll be required to enter a code from your authenticator app each time you log in

### MFA Management

Users can manage their MFA settings through the "Multi-Factor Authentication Settings" expander in the main application:
- View MFA status (enabled/disabled)
- Disable MFA if needed
- Re-enable MFA if previously disabled

For detailed technical implementation information, see [MFA_IMPLEMENTATION.md](MFA_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Setting up Google OAuth Authentication

To enable Google OAuth authentication, you need to configure the application with your Google OAuth credentials.

### Step 1: Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
5. Select "Web application" as the application type
6. Add the following authorized redirect URI:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501/oauth2callback
   ```
7. Click "Create" and note down your Client ID and Client Secret

### Step 2: Configure the Application

1. Rename the `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example` file to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
2. Fill in your Google OAuth credentials:
   ```toml
   [auth]
   redirect_uri = "http://localhost:8501/oauth2callback"
   cookie_secret = "YOUR_RANDOM_COOKIE_SECRET_HERE"  # Generate a random secret
   
   client_id = "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
   client_secret = "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
   server_metadata_url = "https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
   
   # Optional: Specify authorized domains (comma-separated)
   # authorized_domains = "yourcompany.com,partnercompany.com"
   ```
3. Generate a random `cookie_secret` (at least 32 characters)

### Step 3: Configure Account Restrictions

#### Domain Restrictions
To restrict access to specific Google domains:
1. Add the `authorized_domains` setting to your `secrets.toml` file
2. Specify a comma-separated list of domains that are allowed to access the application

Example:
```toml
authorized_domains = "yourcompany.com,partnercompany.com"
```

#### Account Whitelist
To restrict access to specific Google accounts:
1. Set the `AUTHORIZED_ACCOUNTS` environment variable
2. Specify a comma-separated list of email addresses that are allowed to access the application

Example:
```bash
AUTHORIZED_ACCOUNTS=user1@yourcompany.com,user2@partnercompany.com
```

### Step 4: Configure Password Authentication

To enable the second layer of password authentication:

1. Set the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   AUTH_EMAIL=admin@example.com
   AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   ```

2. You can set these in a `.env` file or as system environment variables.

### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run RAG.py
```

## Deployment

For production deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Environment Variables

Configuration options can be set using environment variables:

- `AUTHORIZED_DOMAINS`: Comma-separated list of authorized domains (can also be set in secrets.toml)
- `AUTHORIZED_ACCOUNTS`: Comma-separated list of authorized email addresses
- `AUTH_EMAIL`: Email for password authentication (second layer)
- `AUTH_PASSWORD`: Password for password authentication (second layer)
- Other configuration variables as documented in the original application

## Usage

1. Sign in with your Google account
2. If domain or account restrictions are configured, only authorized users will be able to proceed
3. Enter the application password when prompted
4. Use the interface to ingest PDF documents, review OCR results, and manage stored documents

## Implementation Details

See [GOOGLE_OAUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md](GOOGLE_OAUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed information about how Google OAuth was implemented in this application.
